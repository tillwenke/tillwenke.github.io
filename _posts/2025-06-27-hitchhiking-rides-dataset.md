I worked on predicting waiting time for hitchhikers previously and also wrote about it here.
The dataset that I used from this task stems from `hitchmap.com` (and its predecessors) which I am working on as well.
Now it was time to write a clean summary of this dataset - I decided to do this in the form of a scientific paper.

# Abstract

Hitchhiking, a spontaneous and decentralized mode of travel, has long eluded systematic study due to its informal nature. This paper presents and analyzes the largest
known structured dataset of hitchhiking rides, comprising over 63,000 entries collected over nearly two decades through platforms associated with hitchwiki.org
and lately on hitchmap.com. By leveraging crowd-sourced contributions, the
dataset captures key spatiotemporal and strategic aspects of hitchhiking. This
work documents the dataset’s origins, evolution, and community-driven maintenance, highlighting its Europe-centric distribution, seasonal patterns, and reliance
on a small number of highly active contributors. Through exploratory analyses,
I examine waiting times, user behavior, and comment metadata, shedding light
on the lived realities of hitchhikers. While the dataset has inherent biases and
limitations—such as demographic skew and unverifiable entries it offers a rare
and valuable window into an alternative form of mobility. I conclude by outlining
future directions for enriching the dataset and advancing research on hitchhiking
as both a transportation practice and cultural phenomenon
