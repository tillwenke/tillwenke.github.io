## Ingredients

- 2 packs of smoked tofu
- oil
- sambal oelek
- soy sauce


Alrighty let's go.

Get the oil sizzlin' in a large pan. Meanwhile, thinly slice your tofu.

Add the tofu slices and fry 'em until they are golden brown - not yet crispy. This might take a while - take your time.

Now put a few teaspoons of samal oelek into the pan and give the tofu a last crisp. Make sure not to burn the chili!

Eventually, deglaze with soy sauce just adding the right amount of saltyness to it.

Et voilà! Enjoy.

I can only recommend filling your summer rolls with this tasty ingredient or using it as a meat substitute in any other meal as it has a great umami flavor.
