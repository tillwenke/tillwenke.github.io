Currently in Zürich, Switzerland.

> I am a morally ambitious Master's student in Data Science at ETH Zürich.
> I aim to use machine learning for good, thus I am interested in AI for sustainability and AI safety. Currently, I am shaping the way how data in the gift economy space and especially hitchhiking data is collected and leveraged to promote a society of trust and mutual aid.
> Previously, I helped hidden champions and the public sector to bring machine learning solutions into their organizations.
